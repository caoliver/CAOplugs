The voltage on the Shift jack and the position of the knob are added.
That sum is scaled by 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on the position
of the scale switch.  This is the frequency displacement in Hz.  The V/Oct
silver jack is the input, and the shifted V/Oct comes out the gold.
Thus for a knob set to 4, with in shift voltage of -6, and the switch
in the third (100s) position, the frequency (V/Oct) is shifted by
100*(4-6) = -200Hz.
